  A case table is a char-table which maps characters
  to their lower-case equivalents.  It also has three \"extra\" slots
  which may be additional char-tables or nil.
  These slots are called UPCASE, CANONICALIZE and EQUIVALENCES.
  UPCASE maps each non-upper-case character to its upper-case equivalent.
   (The value in UPCASE for an upper-case character is never used.)
   If lower and upper case characters are in 1-1 correspondence,
   you may use nil and the upcase table will be deduced from DOWNCASE.
  CANONICALIZE maps each character to a canonical equivalent;
   any two characters that are related by case-conversion have the same
   canonical equivalent character; it may be nil, in which case it is
   deduced from DOWNCASE and UPCASE.
  EQUIVALENCES is a map that cyclically permutes each equivalence class
   (of characters with the same canonical equivalent); it may be nil,
   in which case it is deduced from CANONICALIZE."
