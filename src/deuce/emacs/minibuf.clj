  PREDICATE limits completion to a subset of COLLECTION.
  See `try-completion' and `all-completions' for more details
   on completion, COLLECTION, and PREDICATE.

  REQUIRE-MATCH can take the following values:
  - t means that the user is not allowed to exit unless
    the input is (or completes to) an element of COLLECTION or is null.
  - nil means that the user can exit with any input.
  - `confirm' means that the user can exit with any input, but she needs
    to confirm her choice if the input is not an element of COLLECTION.
  - `confirm-after-completion' means that the user can exit with any
    input, but she needs to confirm her choice if she called
    `minibuffer-complete' right before `minibuffer-complete-and-exit'
    and the input is not an element of COLLECTION.
  - anything else behaves like t except that typing RET does not exit if it
    does non-null completion.

  If the input is null, `completing-read' returns DEF, or the first element
  of the list of default values, or an empty string if DEF is nil,
  regardless of the value of REQUIRE-MATCH.

  If INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, insert it in the minibuffer initially,
    with point positioned at the end.
    If it is (STRING . POSITION), the initial input is STRING, but point
    is placed at _zero-indexed_ position POSITION in STRING.  (*Note*
    that this is different from `read-from-minibuffer' and related
    functions, which use one-indexing for POSITION.)  This feature is
    deprecated--it is best to pass nil for INITIAL-INPUT and supply the
    default value DEF instead.  The user can yank the default value into
    the minibuffer easily using M-x next-history-element.

  HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally the initial
    position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the history list
    variable to use, or it can be a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).  In
    that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use, and HISTPOS
    is the initial position (the position in the list used by the
    minibuffer history commands).  For consistency, you should also
    specify that element of the history as the value of
    INITIAL-INPUT.  (This is the only case in which you should use
    INITIAL-INPUT instead of DEF.)  Positions are counted starting from
    1 at the beginning of the list.  The variable `history-length'
    controls the maximum length of a history list.

  DEF, if non-nil, is the default value or the list of default values.

  If INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD is non-nil, the minibuffer inherits
    the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.

  Completion ignores case if the ambient value of
    `completion-ignore-case' is non-nil.

  See also `completing-read-function'."

  "Read a string from the minibuffer, prompting with string PROMPT.
  The optional second arg INITIAL-CONTENTS is an obsolete alternative to
    DEFAULT-VALUE.  It normally should be nil in new code, except when
    HIST is a cons.  It is discussed in more detail below.

  Third arg KEYMAP is a keymap to use whilst reading;
    if omitted or nil, the default is `minibuffer-local-map'.

  If fourth arg READ is non-nil, interpret the result as a Lisp object
    and return that object:
    in other words, do `(car (read-from-string INPUT-STRING))'

  Fifth arg HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list and optionally
    the initial position in the list.  It can be a symbol, which is the
    history list variable to use, or a cons cell (HISTVAR . HISTPOS).
    In that case, HISTVAR is the history list variable to use, and
    HISTPOS is the initial position for use by the minibuffer history
    commands.  For consistency, you should also specify that element of
    the history as the value of INITIAL-CONTENTS.  Positions are counted
    starting from 1 at the beginning of the list.

  Sixth arg DEFAULT-VALUE, if non-nil, should be a string, which is used
    as the default to `read' if READ is non-nil and the user enters
    empty input.  But if READ is nil, this function does _not_ return
    DEFAULT-VALUE for empty input!  Instead, it returns the empty string.

    Whatever the value of READ, DEFAULT-VALUE is made available via the
    minibuffer history commands.  DEFAULT-VALUE can also be a list of
    strings, in which case all the strings are available in the history,
    and the first string is the default to `read' if READ is non-nil.

  Seventh arg INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD, if non-nil, means the minibuffer inherits
   the current input method and the setting of `enable-multibyte-characters'.

  If the variable `minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil,
   then the string which is returned includes whatever text properties
   were present in the minibuffer.  Otherwise the value has no text properties.

  The remainder of this documentation string describes the
  INITIAL-CONTENTS argument in more detail.  It is only relevant when
  studying existing code, or when HIST is a cons.  If non-nil,
  INITIAL-CONTENTS is a string to be inserted into the minibuffer before
  reading input.  Normally, point is put at the end of that string.
  However, if INITIAL-CONTENTS is (STRING . POSITION), the initial
  input is STRING, but point is placed at _one-indexed_ position
  POSITION in the minibuffer.  Any integer value less than or equal to
  one puts point at the beginning of the string.  *Note* that this
  behavior differs from the way such arguments are used in `completing-read'
