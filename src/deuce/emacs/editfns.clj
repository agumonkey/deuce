  %s means print a string argument.  Actually, prints any object, with `princ'.
  %d means print as number in decimal (%o octal, %x hex).
  %X is like %x, but uses upper case.
  %e means print a number in exponential notation.

  %g means print a number in exponential notation

  The argument used for %d, %o, %x, %e, %f, %g or %c must be a number.
  Use %% to put a single % into the output.

  A %-sequence may contain optional flag, width, and precision
  specifiers, as follows:

    %<flags><width><precision>character

  where flags is [+ #-0]+, width is [0-9]+, and precision is .[0-9]+

  The + flag character inserts a + before any positive number, while a
  space inserts a space before any positive number; these flags only
  affect %d, %e, %f, and %g sequences, and the + flag takes precedence.
  The # flag means to use an alternate display form for %o, %x, %X, %e,
  %f, and %g sequences.  The - and 0 flags affect the width specifier,
  as described below.

  The width specifier supplies a lower limit for the length of the
  printed representation.  The padding, if any, normally goes on the
  left, but it goes on the right if the - flag is present.  The padding
  character is normally a space, but it is 0 if the 0 flag is present.
  The 0 flag is ignored if the - flag is present, or the format sequence
  is something other than %d, %e, %f, and %g.

  For %e, %f, and %g sequences, the number after the \".\" in the

  as Universal Time; nil means describe TIME in the local time zone.

  by text that describes the specified date and time in TIME:

  %Y is the year, %y within the century, %C the century.
  %G is the year corresponding to the ISO week, %g within the century.
  %m is the numeric month.
  %b and %h are the locale's abbreviated month name, %B the full name.
  %d is the day of the month, zero-padded, %e is blank-padded.
  %u is the numeric day of week from 1 (Monday) to 7, %w from 0 (Sunday) to 6.
  %a is the locale's abbreviated name of the day of week, %A the full name.
  %U is the week number starting on Sunday, %W starting on Monday,
   %V according to ISO 8601.
  %j is the day of the year.

  %H is the hour on a 24-hour clock, %I is on a 12-hour clock, %k is like %H
   only blank-padded, %l is like %I blank-padded.
  %p is the locale's equivalent of either AM or PM.
  %M is the minute.
  %S is the second.
  %N is the nanosecond, %6N the microsecond, %3N the millisecond, etc.
  %Z is the time zone name, %z is the numeric form.
  %s is the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000.

  %c is the locale's date and time format.
  %x is the locale's \"preferred\" date format.
  %D is like \"%m/%d/%y\".

  %R is like \"%H:%M\", %T is like \"%H:%M:%S\", %r is like \"%I:%M:%S %p\".
  %X is the locale's \"preferred\" time format.

  Finally, %n is a newline, %t is a tab, %% is a literal %.

  Certain flags and modifiers are available with some format controls.
  The flags are `_', `-', `^' and `#'.  For certain characters X,
  %_X is like %X, but padded with blanks; %-X is like %X,
  but without padding.  %^X is like %X, but with all textual
  characters up-cased; %#X is like %X, but with letter-case of
  all textual characters reversed.
  %NX (where N stands for an integer) is like %X,
  but takes up at least N (a number) positions.
  The modifiers are `E' and `O'.  For certain characters X,
  %EX is a locale's alternative version of %X;
  %OX is like %X, but uses the locale's number symbols.

  For example, to produce full ISO 8601 format, use \"%Y-%m-%dT%T%z\"."
