  "Non-nil means that Emacs should use caches to handle long lines more quickly.

  Normally, the line-motion functions work by scanning the buffer for
  newlines.  Columnar operations (like `move-to-column' and
  `compute-motion') also work by scanning the buffer, summing character
  widths as they go.  This works well for ordinary text, but if the
  buffer's lines are very long (say, more than 500 characters), these
  motion functions will take longer to execute.  Emacs may also take
  longer to update the display.

  If `cache-long-line-scans' is non-nil, these motion functions cache the
  results of their scans, and consult the cache to avoid rescanning
  regions of the buffer until the text is modified.  The caches are most
  beneficial when they prevent the most searching---that is, when the
  buffer contains long lines and large regions of characters with the
  same, fixed screen width.

  When `cache-long-line-scans' is non-nil, processing short lines will
  become slightly slower (because of the overhead of consulting the
  cache), and the caches will use memory roughly proportional to the
  number of newlines and characters whose screen width varies.

  The caches require no explicit maintenance; their accuracy is
  maintained internally by the Emacs primitives.  Enabling or disabling
  the cache should not affect the behavior of any of the motion
  functions; it should only affect their performance.")

  The display table is a char-table created with `make-display-table'.
  A char-table is an array indexed by character codes.  Normal array
  primitives `aref' and `aset' can be used to access elements of a char-table.

  Each of the char-table elements control how to display the corresponding
  text character: the element at index C in the table says how to display
  the character whose code is C.  Each element should be a vector of
  characters or nil.  The value nil means display the character in the
  default fashion; otherwise, the characters from the vector are delivered
  to the screen instead of the original character.

  For example, (aset buffer-display-table ?X [?Y]) tells Emacs
  to display a capital Y instead of each X character.

  In addition, a char-table has six extra slots to control the display of:

    the end of a truncated screen line (extra-slot 0, a single character);
    the end of a continued line (extra-slot 1, a single character);
    the escape character used to display character codes in octal

      a vector of characters);

  You can exercise more precise control by using an alist as the

  `bottom', `up', `down', or t, which specifies the default position,
